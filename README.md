# 👋 Hi, I'm Vrajal!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a developer who loves building things that make life easier (or at least more interesting).

## 🚀 What I do

- Full-stack developer (Python | React | AWS | DBMS)
- Enjoy tinkering with new tech and frameworks
- Always up for a coding challenge or brainstorming project ideas

## 🌟 Featured Projects

- [city-planning](https://github.com/Vrajal99/city-planning): Urban planning with a tech twist—check it out!
- [vrajal-chokshi](https://github.com/Vrajal99/vrajal-chokshi): My portfolio site. See what I’m about or grab some inspiration.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python (my go-to for backend magic)
- React (for slick, interactive UIs)
- AWS (cloud stuff is fun)
- DBMS (because data matters)

## 📚 Hobbies & Fun

When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me reading or coming up with new project ideas (that may or may not ever escape my notes app).
